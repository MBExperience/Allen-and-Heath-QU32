Hey all,
       Here are the scripts to making the Allen and Heath QU32 work. I say work, it does allow all faders to now communicate with FL studio and all basic functions like the Transport etc.. But I wrote them for a fellow producer who wanted to get a start on controlling his Allen and Heath QU32. I'm not sure if it covers all of the functions in the Allen and Heath QU32 but he seemed happy with the scripts and their function. I do not have a Allen and Heath QU32 myself so I can't advise on the completness of the scripts.Maybe you could give feedback on the FL studio Forum? I have a Mackie D8B myself and have included the D8B layout just to help you picture how the ports work. 
                  Happy producing
